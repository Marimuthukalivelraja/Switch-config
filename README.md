1)I performed basic switch configuration tasks. I secure access to the command-line
interface (CLI) and console ports using encrypted and plain text passwords. I also learned how to
configure messages for users logging into the switch. These message banners are also used to warn
unauthorized users that access is prohibited.

2) I  implemented basic connectivity by configuring IP addressing on switches and PCs. When the IP addressing configuration is completed, I use various show commands to verify the configuration and  the ping command to verify basic connectivity between devices.
